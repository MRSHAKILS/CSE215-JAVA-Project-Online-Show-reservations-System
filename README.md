 The purpose of this project is to create a Java program for Online Show reservations. The program
 allows users to sign in, view upcoming shows, available shows, and book tickets for the desired show.
 The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for users to navigate and book show tickets
 easily. Automating the ticket booking process, it saves time and effort for both users and show
 authorities.
